# Graphql get dialogs

This directory holds a performance test with POST for `graphql`. The test file `graphql-search.js` is responsible for executing the performance test. It includes a list of end users (ssn) with pre-generated tokens and performs a POST request to the GraphQL endpoint with the payload `input: { party: ["urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:${identifier}"]}`. This test is designed to measure the performance of the GraphQL search functionality. 

## Prerequisites
- [K6 prerequisites](../../README.md#Prerequisites)

## Test file
The test file associated with this performance test is 
- `graphql-search.js`

## Run test
### From cli
1. Navigate to the following directory:
```shell
cd tests/k6/tests/graphql/performance
```
2. Generate tokens using the script below. Make sure to replace `<username>`, `<passwd>` and `(<test|staging|yt01>)` with your desired values:
```shell
TOKEN_GENERATOR_USERNAME=<username> \
TOKEN_GENERATOR_PASSWORD=<passwd> API_ENVIRONMENT=<(test|staging|yt01)> \
../../scripts/generate_tokens.sh ../../performancetest_data personal
```
3. Run the test using the following command. Replace `<(test|staging|yt01)>`, `<vus>`, and `<duration>` with the desired values:
```shell
k6 run graphql-search.js -e API_VERSION=v1 \
-e API_ENVIRONMENT=<(test|staging|yt01)> \
--vus=<vus> --duration=<duration>
```
4. Refer to the k6 documentation for more information on usage.
### From GitHub Actions
To run the performance test using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/altinn/dialogporten/actions/workflows/dispatch-k6-performance.yml) page.
2. Select "Run workflow" and fill in the required parameters.
3. Tag the performance test with a descriptive name.

### GitHub Action with act
To run the performance test locally using GitHub Actions and act, perform the following steps:
1. [Install act](https://nektosact.com/installation/).
2. Navigate to the root of the repository.
3. Create a `.secrets` file that matches the GitHub secrets used. Example:
```file
TOKEN_GENERATOR_USERNAME:<username>
TOKEN_GENERATOR_PASSWORD:<passwd>
K6_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=**
K6_CLOUD_TOKEN=**
K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_USERNAME=**
K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_PASSWORD=**
K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_SERVER_URL=**
```
    Replace `<username>` and `<passwd>`, same as for generating tokens above. Fill in the K6_* values if available, 
    used for reporting to Grafana cloud 
##### IMPORTANT: Ensure this file is added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information. Never commit actual credentials to version control.
4. Run `act` using the command below. Replace `<vus>` and `<duration>` with the desired values:
```shell
act workflow_dispatch -j k6-performance -s GITHUB_TOKEN=`gh auth token` \
--container-architecture linux/amd64 --artifact-server-path $HOME/.act \ 
--input vus=<vus> --input duration=<duration> \ 
--input testSuitePath=tests/k6/tests/graphql/performance/graphql-search.js \ 
--input tokens=personal
```

## Test Results
Test results can be found in GitHub action run log and in App Insights. We are prepared for exporting results to grafana, but so far results are exported to a private grafana instance only, as can be seen from the `.secrets`listed earlier 

## TODO
Fix reporting
